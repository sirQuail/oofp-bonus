Requires Proccessing library
 
Creatures that are procedurally animated using inverse kinematics.
This topic is very interesting to me so I made this demonstration of different skeletons that move "realistically"

Sources that helped me understand and be able to create this:
Rujik on twitter and youtube on procedual animation
The Coding Train forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, and fixed point inverse kinematics
The Rain World animation process on GDC youtube's channel

To run:

-Make sure you have all the files in the project and have processing library.
-Run GameLogic.scala, you may switch between the commented code to see different types.
-Feel free to make your own creature with certain length, size, and color. Maybe even mess with the other files.
-You can also change the default constructors for FixedRope in RopeCreatue.scala to see what happens when you edit amount of joints or leg size.
-You can edit the thickness of the sticks with strokeWeight found in GameBase.scala.
