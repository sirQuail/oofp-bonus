Creatures that are procedurally animated using inverse kinematics.
This topic is very interesting to me so I made this demonstration of different skeletons that move "realistically"

Sources that helped me understand and be able to create this:
Rujik on twitter and youtube on procedual animation
The Coding Train forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, and fixed point inverse kinematics
The Rain World animation process on GDC youtube's channel
